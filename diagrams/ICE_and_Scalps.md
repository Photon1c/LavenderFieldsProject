Primary Source: The Phips Proclamation (1755)
The following text is excerpted from the proclamation issued by Spencer Phips, Lieutenant-Governor of the Province of Massachusetts-Bay, on November 5, 1755. This document is one of the most infamous examples of the legal codification of the scalp trade.
The Legal Text:
"I do hereby require his Majesty’s subjects of this Province to embrace all opportunities of pursuing, captivating, killing and destroying all and every of the aforesaid Indians...
For every male Penobscot Indian above the age of twelve years, that shall be taken within the time aforesaid and brought to Boston, fifty pounds.
For every scalp of a male Penobscot Indian above the age aforesaid, brought in as evidence of their being killed as aforesaid, forty pounds.
For every female Penobscot Indian taken and brought in as aforesaid, and for every male Indian under the age of twelve years, taken and brought in as aforesaid, twenty-five pounds.
For every scalp of such female Indian or male Indian under twelve years of age, brought as evidence of their being killed as aforesaid, twenty pounds."
