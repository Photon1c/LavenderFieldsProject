# The Lavender Fields Project ðŸŒž   
A collection of scripts, models, and simple functions to aid in data analysis and advanced natural system processing frameworks.  

The /scripts and /examples directores are serving similar purposes in this repository. The old adage of not fixing what isn't broken is honored to avoid breaking any links in previous updates.  ðŸ©¹

The general intended process flow for most of the scripts in this project is as follows:
